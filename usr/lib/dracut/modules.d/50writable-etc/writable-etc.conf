# /etc is a subvolume of the read-only root file system, so also mounted
# read-only. Mounting it read-write requires a two step process:
# - Bind mount the subvolume to get a dedicated mount point
# - Remount that bind mount as read-write
# Unfortunately systemd does not support two lines for one mount point,
# so the remount part is done manually here.
ExecStart=/bin/sh -e -c 'if mountpoint -q /sysroot/etc; then mount -o remount,rw /sysroot/etc; fi'
